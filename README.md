# Predicting Wine Grape Varietal Suitability Based on Climate and Precipitation (WIP)

### <u>Introduction</u>

This project will attempt to create a machine learning model that can provide suitability estimates for various wine grape varietals for a certain location based on recent aggregated weather data (such as average temperature during growing season, sun exposure length, and precipitation). The model hopes to addresses issues climate change created for viticulture by being one of the many tools a winemaker could use to test the practicality of changing the varietals they grow, if its an option, or discover new regions for viticulture.&#x20;
